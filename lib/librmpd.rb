# This was written with MPD version 0.11.5 (http://www.musicpd.org)
#
# The main class is the MPD class. This provides the functionality for
# talking to the server as well as setting up callbacks for when events
# occur (such as song changes, state changes, etc). The use of callbacks
# is optional, if they are used a seperate thread will continuously poll
# the server on its status, when something is changed, your program will
# be notified via any callbacks you have set. Most methods are the same
# as specified in the MPD Server Protocol, however some have been modified
# or renamed. Most notable is the list* and lsinfo functions have been
# replace with more sane methods (such as `files` for all files)
#
#== Usage
#
# First create an MPD object
#
#  require 'rubygems'
#  require 'librmpd'
#
#  mpd = MPD.new 'localhost', 6600
#
# and connect it to the server
#
#  mpd.connect
#
# You can now issue any of the commands. Each command is documented below.
#
#=== Callbacks
#
# Callbacks are a way to easily setup your client as event based, rather
# than polling based. This means rather than having to check for changes
# in the server, you setup a few methods that will be called when those
# changes occur. For example, you could have a 'state_changed' method
# that will be called whenever the server changes state. You could then
# have this method change a label to reflect to the new state.
#
# To use callbacks in your program, first setup your callback methods. For
# example, say you have the class MyClient. Simply define whatever
# callbacks you want inside your class. See the documentation on the
# callback type constants in the MPD class for details on how each callback
# is called
#
# Once you have your callback methods defined, use the register_callback
# methods to inform librmpd about them. You can have multiple callbacks
# for each type of callback without problems. Simply use object.method('method_name')
# to get a reference to a Method object. Pass this object to the
# register_callback (along with the proper type value), and you're set.
#       
# An Example:
#
#   class MyClient
#    ...
#    def state_callback( newstate )
#     puts "MPD Changed State: #{newstate}"
#    end
#    ...
#   end
#
#   client = MyClient.new
#   mpd = MPD.new
#   mpd.register_callback(client.method('state_callback'), MPD::STATE_CALLBACK)
#       
#   # Connect and Enable Callbacks
#   mpd.connect( true )
#
# In order for the callback to be used, you must enable callbacks when you
# connect by passing true to the connect method. Now, whenever the state changes
# on the server, myclientobj's state_callback method will be called (and passed
# the new state as an argument)

  # TIME_CALLBACK: This is used to listen for when the playback time changes

  # The callback will always be called with two arguments. The first is
  # the integer number of seconds elapsed (or 0 if errors), the second is
  # the total number of seconds in the song (or 0 if errors)

  # true or false depending on if the repeat flag is set / unset

  # PLAYLIST_LENGTH_CALLBACK: This is used to listen for changes to the

  # CROSSFADE_CALLBACK: This is used to listen for changes in the crossfade
  # setting

  # bitrate
  #
  # The callback will always be called with a single argument, an integer

  BITRATE_CALLBACK = 10

  # AUDIO_CALLBACK: This is used to listen for changes in the audio
  # quality data (sample rate etc)
  #
  # The callback will always be called with three arguments, first,
  # an integer holding the sample rate (or 0 on errors), next an
  # integer holding the number of bits (or 0 on errors), finally an
  # integer holding the number of channels (or 0 on errors)

  # CONNECTION_CALLBACK: This is used to listen for changes in the

  # and a boolean false if it has been disconnected
